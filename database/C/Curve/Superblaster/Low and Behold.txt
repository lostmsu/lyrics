It never rains
But it pours
On a sleepy town
North of New York

It's an old, old score
It's a cold, cold world

How we gloat
At others' misfortune
A nation of reptiles
Given to nothing

It's an old, old score
It's a cold, cold world

Tainted, you could say
But never frightened
For it is not in my nature
I was born of stronger stuff
Lies and deceit
Will never be enough
It's just cause and effect
Effect and frustration
That leads to desperation
And eventual separation

It's an old, old score

It never rains

A nation of reptiles

Given to nothing
